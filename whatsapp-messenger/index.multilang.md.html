# Whatsapp vs Facebook Messenger

I list here several differences between Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger, ordered by importance.

## Whatsapp
- [+++] Répondre à un message, makes conversation with multiple simulatenaous subjects way easier. However, answering by stating the question is good too.
- [+--] Images envoyées s'affichent différemment → Images not in full height, does crop, you have to click to see the full image (annoying).
- [++] Légende sur image 
- [+] Images and Video do not autoload (useful for mobile data usage)
- [++-] Format with bold, italics, stroke : [FAQ](https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/general/26000002). Disadvantage: apprendre le langage (assez court), se souvenir que le langage est là (exemple, le smiley `*_*` est un <strong>_</strong> (underscore en gras). Savoir comment faire un vrai `*`.
- [++] Faster, more integrated, scales well, use better space on screen
- [+++] Forward **multiple** messages.
- [+] More structured _info about message_ stuff. On FB, sometimes buggy to see when a msg is read or sent.
- [++] Secure [end to end](https://www.whatsapp.com/security/) (bout-à-bout in french). 
- [++] Have a list of shared links (along side list of shared photos and documents)
- [+] When typing `:money` on desktop shows, image/emojis corresponding.
- [++] Preview pdf (only the beginning of the document).
- [--] Annoying when _phone is not connected_ but the phone is actually kind of connected to internet (sometimes, he juste has wifi vs 4g issues)
- [---] Annoying When phone has no battery... Or not connected to the internet.

## Facebook
- [+++] Need not to have phone permanently connected to internet to use it on computer
- [+++] Need not to have phone
- [+++] Can do a voice call on computers (Skype replacement, without screen sharing)
- [+] Can like stuffs (fb reaction)... but wazap can answer a message, where people would write like "+1" to agree. becomes annoying when a lot of people just answer "+1".
- Link preview works generally better, sometimes on Whatsapp the preview is not there (which can be the effect we want) but it is not very clear why this happens.
- [++] Emoticons are always vectorial (sometimes on whatsapp we see an ugly bitmap)
- [++] Can copy-paste emojis.
- [++-] Images in full height before you click them, does not crop.
- [++] Experimental plugins Latex/Code (computer only).
- [++] Plugins Chatbot, games, but currently no **good** uses.
- [+] _Is writing_ is close to the Enter zone, not at the top of the page
- [] Can search through messages ! Because not secure end to end. EDIT: Now whatzapp also has that.
- [--] Does not scale well for not wide screen (halfscreen)
- [+] Url to profile (copy pastable, whereas wzap is phone number)
- [+] Transform _:p_, _:)_ etc. to corresponding emoji.
- [++] Preview pdf (only the beginning of the document).

## Whatsapp uses phone number only
- Phone numbers are not as easy and internet friendly as emails, a website cannot send for free a sms whereas it can for mails
- Name of a person depends on your contact name (however each person have a small public profile). This can be a good and a bad thing.
- Messenger can now be only number only
- However have a short identification number is handy, a little bit easier to share than email, but more error prone (a mispelled digit is a no no).
- More difficult to find someone on the network
